3. A way for players to mark an empty space on their turn
4. The game should end when there is a winner, or if the game is a tie

## Stretch Goals

1. A button on game over to reset the game back to initial state
2. A way to keep track of Player 1 vs. Player 2 wins
3. An option to play vs. a computer with AI
4. Level 1: Random empty space is good enough
5. Level 2: Computer chooses a space which immediately blocks a player win
6. Add in the ability to store a game to play later. This might use Firebase or local storage to do so.
7. Add in the ability to play live with somebody remotely. This will definitely need to use Firebase.
